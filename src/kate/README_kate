How to enable syntax highlighting in the text editor 'kate'

(1) Locate the 'syntax' sub-folder in the configuration directory of the kate text editor.
This is the most tricky part. Depending on the version of kate (and of Linux), this folder can be in various places. It may also be missing on some systems. If you have any of the following local directories, try them first. If you cannot find any of them, create and test them one by one.
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/katepart/syntax
$HOME/.kde/share/apps/katepart5/syntax
$HOME/.local/share/apps/katepart/syntax
$HOME/.local/share/apps/katepart5/syntax
Potential system locations of the 'syntax' sub-folder: 
/usr/share/kde4/apps/katepart/syntax
/usr/share/katepart5/syntax

Next, try steps 2-4. If the new syntax highlighting rule does not show up in kate, try another directory.

(2) Place the xml file (cseis.xml) in the 'syntax' directory located or created in step (1).

(3) (re-)Start kate and open an OpenSeaSeis flow file, or create a new/empty one (must have .flow extension)

(4) In the kate menu, select Menu->Tools->Highlighting->Scientific->OpenSeaSeis
From now on, all OpenSeaSeis flows should be automatically associated with this syntax format.
